        <title>GSoC with GNU Wget2 - Part I</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This series of writing summing up of what I did in Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2017.
GSoC 2017 be held in three period of time. In this part I will tell you
about the first period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;community-approaching&quot;&gt;Community Approaching&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After looking for organizations to work on, I decide to choose GNU Wget2 (part
of GNU Project). Why I choose this organization? Some reason I can say:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The codebase is small (but not the scope, for me), it give me advantage
that it’s easy to deploy on my local machine.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It use C as its primary programming language. At this time, I would like to
learn about C (Linux was influenced me) on real world application. I was
starting to learn C but just on the theory. So, working on Wget2 could help me
to learn C with practice.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The GNU Project reputation is well recognized in Open Source community so
working on their project make me proud.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I immediately take a look on their repository. I try to clone their repository
and build on my machine. GNU Wget2 use mailing list as their primary
communication channel, so I sent greeting to them about what project I
interesting at.&lt;br /&gt;
The contributor of the project is so friendly. They give me some clues about
what should I do. I should do some &lt;em&gt;microproject&lt;/em&gt; work to show effort from me to
understand their workflow and also their codebase. That means, I have to send a
patch (there was Github pull request at this time) to the project.  I choose to
work on adding new unit test to function &lt;code&gt;wget_robots_parse()&lt;/code&gt; [0].  Just like
most of open source contribution, it took some process of revision of patch so
it can be merged to upstream. I respect the reviewing process, it help me learn
a lot. Also from now I learn a lot to use &lt;em&gt;GDB (GNU Debugger)&lt;/em&gt; to debug
application.&lt;br /&gt;
At first I choose to use subject “Design and Implementation of a Framework for
Plugins”. But I rethink again because what I do in microproject is about
Testing. Finally I change my subject so I take “Design and Implementation of
Test Suite Using Libmicrohttpd” as my project. I send my proposal to project’s
mailing list [1]. After some reviewing and revision process, I officially sent
my proposal to GSoC homepage and my proposal was accepted.&lt;br /&gt;
The project aim to use Libmicrohttpd as test suite for Wget2. I planned to
complete this by change on function &lt;code&gt;wget_test_start_server()&lt;/code&gt; also
&lt;code&gt;wget_test_stop_server()&lt;/code&gt; from src/libtest.c of Wget2. With this
approach, I don’t need to change existing test suite which call the internal
server code through functions mentioned above.&lt;br /&gt;
I’ve count there are 36 test file which use
&lt;code&gt;wget_test_start_server()&lt;/code&gt;. I must ensure all the test passed.  And
for installation prerequisite, I must ensure that Libmicrohttpd are included
when building Wget2 binary. Then I need to modify configure.ac. I will give
proper warning about this requirement. There is a section in README.md where I
must explain to user to provide Libmicrohttpd to make all test running
correctly.  With Libmicrohttpd I can add new test using feature that not yet
implemented in old server code, but ready on Libmicrohttpd, such as HTTP
authentication and concurrent request checking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;community-bonding-period&quot;&gt;Community Bonding Period&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During this period, I spend my time to learn codebase about Wget2 and
Libmicrohttpd. I was busy to learning them, that I forget to stay active in
community. To prevent mentors give me minus points, I try to work on an issue. I
try an easy one, adding enhancement for capabilities of file extended
attributes. In short words, Wget2 could save target file’s extended attributes
if filesystem support it. It is like the feature on Wget 1.x. To solve this
issue, I have to dive a little bit on Wget2 codebase. That’s give me a view
about how Wget2 works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;1st-week&quot;&gt;1st Week&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There comes the first week of my official coding period. I was work on some
basic tasks for this projects, such as modify the build tools. I have modifed
configure.ac to include Libmicrohttpd into Wget2. I just include the package,
and not adding, modifying or removing anything else yet.&lt;br /&gt;
With Libmicrohttpd becomes mandatory package to install before building Wget2
binary, there must be proper warning about this requirement, otherwise the
building process will fail. I have add oneliner information into README.md.
Actually, I was misunderstood about this. Christian Grothoff then give me
suggestion to correct it. Dependency to Libmicrohttpd should not become
mandatory. The solution it to make conditionally-compile and run the tests only
if Libmicrohttpd is present while build Wget2. Libmicrohttpd does the same for
Libcurl. Making the dependency optional also avoids the obvious possibility of
circular dependencies if we ever were to add Libwget2-based tests to
Libmicrohttpd.&lt;br /&gt;
Tim Ruhsen also reminds that I should to skip the appropriate tests if
Libmicrohttpd is not installed/ available. I should definitely avoid to use
Wget2 legacy server code in Libwget and focus on client functionality instead.
Because after we successfully integrating Libmicrohttpd, we should remove the
legacy server code. I finally understood what they mean and will fix this the
next week.&lt;br /&gt;
On the CI/CD section, I have ensured that all make check passed on several
testing machine including: Debian/GCC, Fedora/Clang, MingW64 and OSX.
Fortunately, most of those OS have provided Libmicrohttpd package on their
respective repository, except MingW64 (the representation of Windows build).
Especially for MingW64 build, because I haven’t found the correct package for
Libmicrohttpd, I include Libmicrohttpd by download the source and compile
manually. What I’ve done is add the following lines on .gitlab-ci.yml:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;before_script:
- dnf -y install wget
- wget http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/libmicrohttpd/libmicrohttpd-0.9.55.tar.gz
- tar zxf libmicrohttpd-0.9.55.tar.gz &amp;amp;&amp;amp; cd libmicrohttpd-0.9.55/
- mingw64-configure --prefix=/usr/x86_64-w64-mingw32/sys-root/mingw/
- mingw64-make -j$(nproc)
- mingw64-make -j$(nproc) LOG_COMPILER=wine install
- cd -
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asking if my step was right. Tim give me advice on that MingW64 issue, that I
should provide a script (e.g. in contrib/ folder) that will
downloads/builds/installs Libmicrohttpd. That script then added to the CI runner
YAML file(s) so we can test on MinGW64 as well. This will keep us to stay run as
many tests as possible. He suggest that I should move my MinGW64 build script to
contrib in the end of GSOC as a cleanup.&lt;br /&gt;
On the other hand, Evgeny Grin tell me there is a package for Libmicrohttpd on
MinGW64, it provided on Msys2 project and has HTTPS support. Another solution,
is to use W32 binary build provided on GNU mirrors, but it has not HTTPS
support. I keep this information for later decision. For now, I should focus on
the test code first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2nd-week&quot;&gt;2nd Week&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things get more interesting. Because in this period, I will starting to work on
Wget2 main testing function. I started on &lt;code&gt;wget_test_start_server()&lt;/code&gt;.
I must change that function in order to call Libmicrohttpd as service for
&lt;code&gt;wget_test()&lt;/code&gt;. Workflow to resolve this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Disable initial process for HTTP server socket.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Disable &lt;code&gt;_http_server_thread&lt;/code&gt;, instead call new function which call
Libmicrohttpd.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Create &lt;code&gt;_http_server()&lt;/code&gt; function, wrapper for Libmicrohttpd. There
is also function &lt;code&gt;ahc_eco()&lt;/code&gt; which use to create proper HTTP
response.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some issues I found in this period:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Decide what the best threading model for Libmicrohttpd. I currently using
&lt;code&gt;MHD_USE_INTERNALLY_POLLING_THREAD&lt;/code&gt; which use external select. I still check
the comparison with legacy code that use Wget2 API &lt;code&gt;wget_thread_start&lt;/code&gt;.
Darshit Shah give me a clue, that I should choose any mechanism that uses
&lt;code&gt;select()&lt;/code&gt;. Then we can change the threading model at a later stage if it
turns out to be a bottleneck. &lt;code&gt;epoll&lt;/code&gt; is Linux-only and even &lt;code&gt;poll&lt;/code&gt; isn’t
always available, so as long as I choose a &lt;code&gt;select&lt;/code&gt; based implementation, it
should be fine. Evgeny said that I can use &lt;code&gt;MHD_is_feature_supported()&lt;/code&gt; with
&lt;code&gt;MHD_FEATURE_POLL&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;MHD_FEATURE_EPOLL&lt;/code&gt; to check for supported polling
functions.  Alternatively, with latest versions of Libmicrohttpd I can use
&lt;code&gt;MHD_USE_AUTO&lt;/code&gt; and Libmicrohttpd will choose &lt;code&gt;select()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;poll()&lt;/code&gt; or
epoll-based polling automatically.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I make the &lt;code&gt;http_server_port&lt;/code&gt; still hardcoded. Darshit tell me that this
becomes important note. The port should be a random number. Usually, passing 0
in the port number makes the kernel choose an open one for it. Having a
randomised port is important to ensure that multiple runs don’t step on each
other.&lt;br /&gt;
I think still don’t know how to accomplish this. Maybe, it just my understanding
that when I pass 0 in MHD port number, the result is still 0.  Another
approach, when I look into the old code, it generate port number by calling
&lt;code&gt;wget_tcp_get_local_port()&lt;/code&gt;. But, I need to call &lt;code&gt;wget_tcp_init()&lt;/code&gt; and
&lt;code&gt;wget_tcp_listen()&lt;/code&gt; respectively in order to get proper result.  Conclusion, do
I need to use existing &lt;code&gt;wget_tcp_get_local_port()&lt;/code&gt; to get the port, or maybe
there is a function in Libmicrohttpd to do that.&lt;br /&gt;
Tim added that all I need is the socket descriptor. How to call
&lt;code&gt;getsockname()&lt;/code&gt; + &lt;code&gt;getnameinfo()&lt;/code&gt; to retrieve the port number I see in
&lt;code&gt;libwget/net.c&lt;/code&gt;/ &lt;code&gt;wget_tcp_get_local_port()&lt;/code&gt;. If Libmicrohttpd doesn’t have
such a function, either try to get the socket descriptor or extend
Libmicrohttpd with a small function (similar code as in
&lt;code&gt;wget_tcp_get_local_port&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;
Evgeny give more detailed explanations. There are several ways to resolve it:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Initialise socket externally and start &lt;code&gt;listen()&lt;/code&gt; on it. I can use any bind
and port detection function. Pass socket &lt;code&gt;FD&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;MHD_start_daemon()&lt;/code&gt; by
&lt;code&gt;MHD_OPTION_LISTEN_SOCKET&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Use &lt;code&gt;MHD_start_daemon()&lt;/code&gt; with “0” as port number then use
&lt;code&gt;MHD_get_daemon_info()&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;MHD_DAEMON_INFO_LISTEN_FD&lt;/code&gt; to get listen
socket FD. Use any port detection.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Use &lt;code&gt;MHD_start_daemon()&lt;/code&gt; with “0” as port number then use
&lt;code&gt;MHD_get_daemon_info()&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;MHD_DAEMON_INFO_BIND_PORT&lt;/code&gt; to get port
number.  Works with &lt;code&gt;MHD_VERSION &amp;gt;= 0x00095501&lt;/code&gt; and on platforms that
support &lt;code&gt;getsockname()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
I can combine second and third methods.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  int port_num;

  if(0) {}
#if MHD_VERSION &amp;gt;= 0x00095501
  else if (MHD_NO !=
     MHD_is_feature_supported (MHD_FEATURE_AUTODETECT_BIND_PORT))
  {
    const union MHD_DaemonInfo *dinfo;
    dinfo = MHD_get_daemon_info (d, MHD_DAEMON_INFO_BIND_PORT);
    if (NULL == dinfo || 0 == dinfo-&amp;gt;port)
    {
      /* Insert code to handle error. */
      return -1;
    }
    port_num = (int)dinfo-&amp;gt;port;
  }
#endif /* MHD_VERSION &amp;gt;= 0x00095501 */
  else
  {
    const union MHD_DaemonInfo *dinfo;
    MHD_socket sock_fd;
    dinfo = MHD_get_daemon_info (d, MHD_OPTION_LISTEN_FD);
    if (NULL == dinfo)
    {
      /* Insert code to handle error. */
      return -1;
    }
    sock_fd = dinfo-&amp;gt;listen_fd;
    /* Insert code to use port detection on provided socket. */
  }

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He add note that socket type used by MHD functions is &lt;code&gt;MHD_socket&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;code&gt;MHD_socket&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; on POSIX platforms (Linux, *BSD, Unix, Darwin) and
&lt;code&gt;SOCKET&lt;/code&gt; on Windows platform (excluding Cygwin, where &lt;code&gt;MHD_socket&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In &lt;code&gt;ahc_eco()&lt;/code&gt; of Libmicrohttpd, urls data still using static checking for
matching with requested urls. In other word, it’s hardcoded. It needs to be
changed to dynamic method to accomodate variadic data.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I still not touched HTTPS yet.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I ask about what to do with FTP and FTPS functions. Since Libmicrohttpd just
provide service for HTTP. I was asking, do we need keep the function for
FTP{s}, or removing it. Darshit told me that we keep the FTP code intact for
now. Then we should look into different libraries that provide a FTP server in
C and try to integrate that into your test suite as well. But for this period,
it is out of scope.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The test was failed when I try to resolve URL with question mark. For example:
&lt;code&gt;/subdir1/subpage1.html?query&amp;amp;param&lt;/code&gt;, when I debug, it return just
&lt;code&gt;/subdir1/subpage1.html&lt;/code&gt; so the result is 404 not found. I also check using
logging example source code provided in Libmicrohttpd tutorial. When I access
using http client such as Wget2 and Firefox, the result is still the same. The
URL result omit the query part. I confirm to Libmicrohttpd side about
this, whether it is intended behaviour or not. Christian said it that’s
intended, for URL parameters/arguments I need to use
&lt;code&gt;MHD_get_connection_values()&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;kind=MHD_GET_ARGUMENT_KIND&lt;/code&gt; to inspect
them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;3rd-week&quot;&gt;3rd Week&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on feedback from mentors on the previous week, I made some fixes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Remove initial process for HTTP server socket.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Create &lt;code&gt;_http_server_start()&lt;/code&gt; function, wrapper for Libmicrohttpd. There is
also function &lt;code&gt;answer_to_connection()&lt;/code&gt; which use to create proper HTTP
response.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use select method &lt;code&gt;(MHD_USE_SELECT_INTERNALLY)&lt;/code&gt; for threading model in
Libmicrohttpd to get better compatibility.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;http_server_port&lt;/code&gt; seized automatically using Libmicrohttpd function by
passing &lt;code&gt;MHD_DAEMON_INFO_BIND_PORT&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;MHD_DAEMON_INFO_LISTEN_FD&lt;/code&gt; parameter
to &lt;code&gt;MHD_get_daemon_info()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Using iteration to parse urls data in &lt;code&gt;answer_to_connection()&lt;/code&gt;. This
guarantee we can pass any variadic data to Libmicrohttpd and prevent
segmentation fault.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fix &lt;code&gt;answer_to_connection()&lt;/code&gt; function to create proper HTTP response (to deal
with parameters and arguments on url, to add proper HTTP headers).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;4th-week&quot;&gt;4th Week&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally it comes to the end of the first period. I report to mentors what I’ve
done in this week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I have finished modify configure.ac to include Libmicrohttpd into Wget2.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I have ensured that all make check passed on several testing machine
including: Debian/GCC, Fedora/Clang, MingW64 and OSX.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Started working on &lt;code&gt;wget_test_start_server()&lt;/code&gt;. Workflow to resolve this:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Remove initial process for HTTP server socket.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Create &lt;code&gt;_http_server_start()&lt;/code&gt; function, wrapper for Libmicrohttpd. There is
also function &lt;code&gt;answer_to_connection()&lt;/code&gt; which use to create proper HTTP
response.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Use select method (&lt;code&gt;MHD_USE_SELECT_INTERNALLY&lt;/code&gt;) for threading model in
Libmicrohttpd to get better compatibility.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;http_server_port seized automatically using Libmicrohttpd function by
passing &lt;code&gt;MHD_DAEMON_INFO_BIND_PORT&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;MHD_DAEMON_INFO_LISTEN_FD&lt;/code&gt; parameter
to &lt;code&gt;MHD_get_daemon_info()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Using iteration to parse urls data in &lt;code&gt;answer_to_connection()&lt;/code&gt;. This
guarantee we can pass any variadic data to Libmicrohttpd and prevent
segmentation fault.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Fix &lt;code&gt;answer_to_connection()&lt;/code&gt; function to create proper HTTP response (to deal
with parameters and arguments on url, to add proper HTTP headers).&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I must ensure that all test suite running correctly. To give better
visualization, I’ve created spreadsheet about summary of test file which use
&lt;code&gt;wget_test_start_server()&lt;/code&gt;. Currently, as far as I know, it reaches 87.5% (28
of 32). I need to complete all test suite reach 100%.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After I send it to the mailing list, I have got many feedback from my mentors
for this report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Darshit trying to check my code, he has noticed that I was working only
on a single branch and have only one commit until the date. This much work is
not enough for the mid semester evaluation. He asks me to split my work into
smaller commits which are discrete units of work. I follow up this with breaking
down my previous one big commit into smaller ones so it could represent my work
in period of time.&lt;br /&gt;
About the commit style, he gave me a clear clue. My commit messages are pretty
hard to read. Also, he asks to maintain the standard style of commit messages.
At Wget, the commit messages are converted into a ChangeLog, hence my message
should be written in that format.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;git commit

Commit Message title (60 chars)
[Blank Line]
* file_changed(function_name): Description of change
* file_changed(function_name): Description of change

Any other details I want to write
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The commit messages I have written are actually fine, but when it exceeds 60 chars in
the first line, I should convert my message to the longer format he just
described.&lt;br /&gt;
Another thing, he asks to not force push to my (&lt;em&gt;master&lt;/em&gt;) branches. There are
other people that pull from these branches to check in on the code. If I force
push, it messes the repository up for all. Force pushing should only be reserved
as a last resort. However, in this case, when I rewrite the commit messages, I
should force push to my own current branch. That will allow me to maintain that
branch later.&lt;br /&gt;
The CI system states failures. He asks whether this is an expected failures. I
said that it not intended to be failure. On my machine which use Ubuntu/GCC, I
can run &lt;code&gt;make check&lt;/code&gt;, and some test could pass. Same like on Gitlab CI that use
Debian/GCC. Based on CI artifacts, most of them failed on &lt;code&gt;make check-valgrind&lt;/code&gt;
that I miss to check before. I still find out how to deal with this memory leak
error. Actually, I still stuck in this. Then I ask, how to debug using Valgrind.
I read the error logs and it still it pointed me out of nowhere. He said that I
really should discuss these issues with them more. That is exactly why they are
here to mentor me. Valgrind’s memcheck tool which is what is being used in the
&lt;code&gt;make check-valgrind&lt;/code&gt; is a memory leak checker. He will look a little into it
once he can get the basic tests running on his machine. I asked to be focus on
that first. He said we will look into the memory leaks in a while. Most probably
the leaks happen because either I lost the pointer to some allocated memory or
are using the libmicrohttpd API wrong and forgot to &lt;code&gt;free()&lt;/code&gt; some data structure
returned by it.&lt;br /&gt;
He also sees that ./configure always tries to link Libmicrohttpd. But Wget2
should not depend on that. It should try to add the linker flags &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; when
trying to compile the test suite. The Wget2 binary should not use that flag. I
realize that was there are flaws in my code. I will figure out after some work
against other test files.&lt;br /&gt;
On his local system, not a single test passes. &lt;code&gt;make check -j$(nproc)&lt;/code&gt; causes a
segmentation fault and a simple &lt;code&gt;make check&lt;/code&gt; gets stuck on test-wget-1 and never
progresses ahead. He asks me to fix the branch and/or provide them with
information on how to make the tests work. I look at CI system with Fedora/Clang
and indeed the result is all segmentation faults. I still have no clue about
that. With this case, I cannot claim that I have almost 85% tests passing
already. From his perspective, it is still 0%.&lt;br /&gt;
In fact, all the tests that my spread sheet marks are passes, end up causing a
segfault on his system. This seems to stem from the fact that the
&lt;code&gt;http_server_tid&lt;/code&gt; is stored as “0” and I try to call &lt;code&gt;pthread_cancel&lt;/code&gt; on that
value. I asks for more detail information about this. I have use some advice
from Evgeny Grin how to deal with dynamic port. Even when I use hard coded port,
the result is still the same. He explains that he don’t think this is connected
to the port number at all. If it is, then my variable naming scheme requires a
serious change. This issue is happening because I have never stored the tid of
the server in the variable, but I still try to cancel that thread id. After I
take a look on my code again, I realize something wrong. Darshit was right. That
segmentation fault error happened because I forgot to remove
&lt;code&gt;wget_thread_cancel&lt;/code&gt;(&lt;code&gt;http_server_tid&lt;/code&gt;) which is used by the old code at server
termination time. After I remove that line, the CI runner of Fedora/Clang
passes some tests, not all test were resulted segmentation fault (14 of 32
pass, while 4 skipped). The other fail because likely Valgrind check error.&lt;br /&gt;
Darshit asks me to make sure that my code works as I have mentioned at least one day
before the deadline for the evaluations. On my Week 3 report I planned to get
100% of passing all of the test suite. But, until Week 4, my job still not yet
all done (even excluding other error generated outside &lt;code&gt;make check&lt;/code&gt; on
Debian/GCC system). I realized I have missed my (personal) target. Hence, he
asks me where do I think I missed out which caused me to fall behind. In
hindsight, he asks what according to me could have been done better. So, I and
they should be look into this together to see where it can be improved. He asks
what topics were I most stuck on, and why did it take me so much time. Also, if
I stuck on any single point for more than a day, he asks to send they a message.
There is a very good chance that they might be able to help me out and fix it
much faster.&lt;br /&gt;
Darshit sends a message to both Libmicrohttpd maintainers, Christian and Evgeny:
that the issues in Valgrind seem to come from within Libmicrohttpd. One of the
blocks reported by Valgrind is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;=26290== 72 bytes in 3 blocks are still reachable in loss record 6 of 6
==26290==    at 0x4C2BEEF: malloc (in
/usr/lib/valgrind/vgpreload_memcheck-amd64-linux.so)
==26290==    by 0x7E06608: ??? (in /usr/lib/libgcrypt.so.20.1.7)

==26290==    by 0x9: ???
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, he guess is that this is some memory that is being allocated by Libmicrohttpd.
The test code does indeed seem to call &lt;code&gt;MHD_stop_daemon()&lt;/code&gt; which should
ideally ensure a clean exit. He asks, where did the implementation go wrong.&lt;br /&gt;
Christian said this is a bit hard to evaluate without the debug symbols. Most
likely it would be a false-positive from a globally allocated buffer of
Libgcrypt’s initialization sequence. He asks to download and install debug
symbols for Libgcrypt and ideally Libmicrohttpd. It is unlikely to be
Libmicrohttpd fault, as except for responses there are no Libmicrohttpd buffers
my code would have to free.&lt;br /&gt;
Evgeny gives a review about my works, direct pointed to the code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;static char *_scan_directory(const char* data)
{
      char *path = strchr(data, '/');
      if (path != 0) {
              return path;
      }
      else
              return NULL;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He asks why do I use underscore as prefix for functions. Usually it is used by
libraries to avoid name conflict. First, I think that I need to remove the
underscore, then Tim also give comment that this is also useful in projects
where there is more than one C file. They use it to make clear that a
function/variable is static (not consequently everywhere, though). So, I
still keep the underscore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;static char *_parse_hostname(const char* data)
{
      if (!wget_strncasecmp_ascii(data, &quot;http://&quot;, 7)) {
              char *path = strchr(data += 7, '/');
              return path;
      } else
              return NULL;
}

static char *_replace_space_with_plus(char *data)
{
      if (strchr(data, ' ') != 0) {
              char *result = data;
              char *wk, *s;

              wk = s = strdup(data);

              while (*s != 0) {
                      if (*s == ' '){
                              *data++ = '+';
                              ++s;
                      } else
                              *data++ = *s++;
              }
              *data = '\0';
              free(wk);
              return result;
      } else
              return data;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He asks me about the reason for using &lt;code&gt;strdup()&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;free()&lt;/code&gt;. I checked string
twice (by &lt;code&gt;strchr()&lt;/code&gt; and by my custom iterations). It just waste of CPU time.
He gives simpler implementation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;{
  while(0 != *data)
  {
    if (' ' == *data)
      *data = '+';
    data++;
  }
  return data;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I applied the changes to my code.&lt;br /&gt;
Evgeny also give note that according to current HTTP specification ‘+’ must NOT be
used as replacement for ‘ ’ in URLs. When I learn about this problem, it
leads me to here [2]. Then if it need to be applied, I need to modify test
file: test-base.c to not use ‘+’, and use %2B instead.&lt;br /&gt;
Tim added that the ‘+’ was always just for the query part. He asks to Evgeny
what document are you exactly referring to to. Not that he is against dropping
the ‘+’ rule, but what consortium is not accepted as normative by everyone,
while IETF is. He is unsure about what ‘spec’ to follow. So, I keep my changes
of ‘+’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;static int print_out_key(void *cls, enum MHD_ValueKind kind, const char *key,
                                              const char *value)
{
      if (key &amp;amp;&amp;amp; url_it == 0 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; url_it2 == 0) {
              wget_buffer_strcpy(url_arg, &quot;?&quot;);
              _replace_space_with_plus((char *) key);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evgeny said that we are not allowed to modify any content pointed by pointer to
const. By dropping ‘const’ qualifiers are violating API. In other words: I was
modifying internal structures that are not expected to be modified and the
result is unpredictable. I fixed them then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;              wget_buffer_strcat(url_arg, key);
              if (value) {
                      wget_buffer_strcat(url_arg, &quot;=&quot;);
                      _replace_space_with_plus((char *) value);
                      wget_buffer_strcat(url_arg, value);
              }
      }
      if (key &amp;amp;&amp;amp; url_it != 0 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; url_it2 == 0) {
              wget_buffer_strcat(url_arg, &quot;&amp;amp;&quot;);
              _replace_space_with_plus((char *) key);
              wget_buffer_strcat(url_arg, key);
              if (value) {
                      wget_buffer_strcat(url_arg, &quot;=&quot;);
                      _replace_space_with_plus((char *) value);
                      wget_buffer_strcat(url_arg, value);
              }
      }
      url_it++;
    return MHD_YES;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He also gives me some questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Is &lt;code&gt;url_arg&lt;/code&gt; a global variable?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do I use single thread only?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Why not to pass pointer to &lt;code&gt;url_arg&lt;/code&gt; as &lt;code&gt;cls&lt;/code&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What about &lt;code&gt;url_it&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;url_it2&lt;/code&gt;? It is hard to guess meaning from name.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I need to pass all of them, I was advised to define some structure with three
pointers and pass pointer to structure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;static int answer_to_connection (void *cls,
                                      struct MHD_Connection *connection,
                                      const char *url,
                                      const char *method,
                                      const char *version,
                                      const char *upload_data, size_t *upload_data_size, void **con_cls)
{
      struct MHD_Response *response;
      int ret;

      url_arg = wget_buffer_alloc(1024);
      MHD_get_connection_values (connection, MHD_GET_ARGUMENT_KIND, print_out_key, NULL);

      url_it2 = url_it;
      wget_buffer_t *url_full = wget_buffer_alloc(1024);
      wget_buffer_strcpy(url_full, url);
      if (url_arg)
              wget_buffer_strcat(url_full, url_arg-&amp;gt;data);
      if (!strcmp(url_full-&amp;gt;data, &quot;/&quot;))
              wget_buffer_strcat(url_full, &quot;index.html&quot;);
      url_it = url_it2 = 0;
      unsigned int itt, found = 0;
      for (itt = 0; itt &amp;lt; nurls; itt++) {
              char *dir = _scan_directory(url_full-&amp;gt;data + 1);
              if (dir != 0 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; !strcmp(dir, &quot;/&quot;))
                      wget_buffer_strcat(url_full, &quot;index.html&quot;);

              char *host = _parse_hostname(url_full-&amp;gt;data);
              if (host != 0 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; !strcmp(host, &quot;/&quot;))
                      wget_buffer_strcat(url_full, &quot;index.html&quot;);

              wget_buffer_t *iri_url = wget_buffer_alloc(1024);
              wget_buffer_strcpy(iri_url, urls[itt].name);
              MHD_http_unescape(iri_url-&amp;gt;data);

              if (urls[itt].code != NULL &amp;amp;&amp;amp;
                      !strcmp(urls[itt].code, &quot;302 Redirect&quot;) &amp;amp;&amp;amp;
                      !strcmp(url_full-&amp;gt;data, iri_url-&amp;gt;data))
              {
                      response = MHD_create_response_from_buffer(strlen(&quot;302 Redirect&quot;),
                                      (void *) &quot;302 Redirect&quot;, MHD_RESPMEM_PERSISTENT);
                      for (int itt2 = 0; urls[itt].headers[itt2] != NULL; itt2++) {
                              const char *header = urls[itt].headers[itt2];
                              if (header) {
                                      char *header_value = strchr(header, ':');
                                      char *header_key = wget_strmemdup(header, header_value - header);
                                      MHD_add_response_header(response, header_key, header_value + 2);
                                      ret = MHD_queue_response(connection, MHD_HTTP_FOUND, response);
                                      wget_xfree(header_key);
                                      itt = nurls;
                                      found = 1;
                              } else
                                      itt = nurls;
                      }
              } else if (!strcmp(url_full-&amp;gt;data, iri_url-&amp;gt;data)) {
                      response = MHD_create_response_from_buffer(strlen(urls[itt].body),
                                      (void *) urls[itt].body, MHD_RESPMEM_PERSISTENT);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He asks me again to ensure that content of &lt;code&gt;urls[itt].body&lt;/code&gt; will be valid until
end of this connection. Otherwise you must use &lt;code&gt;MHD_RESPMEM_MUST_COPY&lt;/code&gt; as last
parameter. I followed his advice and fix my code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two generic advises he gave to me:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Avoid using global variables.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use better names for variables. It it hard to understand what mean
&lt;code&gt;iri_url&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;itt&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;itt2&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;first-period-evaluations&quot;&gt;First Period Evaluations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After finish my 4th period report, I also must complete first evaluation report
via GSoC web app. I passed the evaluations, but with warning. Mentors give me an
important messages about what happened and what should I improve.&lt;br /&gt;
The project is indeed behind schedule. The mentors still give me a chance by passing
me in the hopes that I and they will be able to improve the communication and
get the project back on track. One major suggestion is that I increase the
frequency of my project reports from weekly to daily. Just a single line at the
end of each day stating what I have done and what are my plans for the next
day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was though days with my first time period of GSoC. There was many jobs left
to be finished in the next period. Mistakes happen, but I was learn a lot from
them.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Workflow on Contributing to Open Source Project</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In the open source world, different project comes with different workflow, using
different medium. For instance, Linux Kernel development, use mailing list to
gather patches for many developer around the world. The maintainer pick
patches from developer with careful supervision. Then, they maintain release of
the stable version, while Linus Torvalds himself maintain the mainline stream.&lt;br /&gt;
Other project, Git – a revision control system. It use same model as Linux
Kernel, patches and conversations go to mailing list. With additional part, for
the Continuous Integration system, it is recommended to use Github and Travis
CI. Although they will reject all pull request from there.&lt;br /&gt;
Another example, Wget2 used Github mainly to perform collaboration (Because GNU
not allowed their project to use Github, their move it to Gitlab [0]). Issues are
discussed here. Pull request also getting merged here. Although, it also have
mailing list to discuss issues and problems.&lt;br /&gt;
Here I share my experience how I contribute to open source, so my code could be
merged in the project upstream. For an example, I will write several steps of
my way doing Wget2 project for my GSoC 2017 application. Below are some points I
follow:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;obtain-source-code&quot;&gt;Obtain Source Code&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Startup procedures:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fork project so you can modify yourself via Gitlab interface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;git clone https://gitlab.com/dstw/wget2
git remote add upstream https://dstw@gitlab.com/gnuwget/wget2.git
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create an own branch for each ‘task’ you are working on and make your commits
within it. When done, sync with upstream, rebase/merge and create your patches
via format-patch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do not make changes to your branch ‘master’ - this should always reflect the
original repo. This makes it easy for you to update your ‘master’ branch with
changes from the ‘original/upstream’ master branch on Savannah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sync your Gitlab repo with upstream:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;git checkout master
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/master
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sync your ‘new-feature’ branch before generating patches:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;git checkout new-feature
git rebase master
git push -f  # pushing updated tree to your Gitlab new-feature branch)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assume ‘new-feature’ is a private branch where you can do all the dirty things
that you shouldn’t on public/shared branches. As soon as your patch has been
accepted, remove the branch ‘new-feature’ locally and from Gitlab.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;build-the-executables&quot;&gt;Build the Executables&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As prerequisite, install all mandatory software as listed in README.md.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;find-the-problems&quot;&gt;Find the Problems&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I usually look at Wget2 Gitlab issues pages to find issues and problems which
appropriate to newcomer like me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;make-changes-to-the-code&quot;&gt;Make Changes to the Code&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this part, my knowledge in coding skill are truly challenged. Wget2 use C as
its programming language. In my case, I just add some test based on requirements
and of course with help from other contributors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;create-pullmerge-request&quot;&gt;Create Pull/Merge Request&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After I feel my code ready to merge, I push my commit to upstream and make a
pull request from Gitlab interface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;wait-for-review&quot;&gt;Wait for Review&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After create a merge request, I wait for feedback, criticism, suggestions, etc.
from other developer.&lt;br /&gt;
Respond to it! and follow up with improved versions of your change. Even for a
trivial patch you shouldn’t be surprised if it takes two or more iterations
before your patch is accepted. This is the best part of participating in the Git
community; it is your chance to get personalized instruction from very
experienced peers!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;propose-new-change&quot;&gt;Propose New Change&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After getting a review, do some improvement. After all, make a new commit. Here,
there is option to overwrite my existing commits or create new merge commits to
keep history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;git push origin new-feature
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there is a conflict, Git will ask me to resolve the problem this. Then, try
to push and merge commits. This won’t remove any existing commits. And if I
don’t want to keep any commits history, I usually force to push:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;git push -f origin new-feature
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;del&gt;This is considered a little bit harmful. Before I do this, I will make sure
that I know what I do. Also, forcing commits is should only do if it believed to
final commits or at least near final, I should not do any more change to it.&lt;/del&gt; 
Just make sure that I don’t force push to the &lt;strong&gt;master&lt;/strong&gt; branch of the project,
otherwise, is safe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, after some iteration, if project maintainer agree with my changes, then
they will merge it into their repository. If not, I should be take a look on my
proposed changes more carefully, what could be wrong and what should be fixed.
And the best of it all, I could learn a lot from the process.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Google Summer of Code Preparation</title>
        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;GSoC (Google Summer of Code), a program where university students spend their
3 month summer break coding on an open source project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That time finally comes. After almost one year I have been lurking, observing,
it’s time to decide whether I will participate or not. It’s not easy
to find organization who fit with who I am. But anyway, this year, I will try.&lt;br /&gt;
Despite administrative prerequisite, such as proof of enrollment, there are some
technical stuff involving coding activities we need to do, which is fun.
This is a list of what I’ve done so far in order to be considered as good
candidate:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;pick-a-project-with-programming-language-that-i-passionate-about&quot;&gt;Pick a project with programming language that I passionate about&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a word “code” in Google Summer of Code, meaning programming will be my main
activity in this program. So, I must find which project that has programming
language, that I familiar with. This is to avoid, I will stuck about the tasks
that will assigned to me as a program applicant.&lt;br /&gt;
Actually, it can be done even long ago before the program being announced. I can
look at the GSoC archive. But, sometimes term will change as the organization
announced. Some organization will participate again, while others not. So, for
me it better to prepare after the program announced officially.&lt;br /&gt;
From there, I can see which project fit with my programming language, one that I
love. So, after some effort of filtering and analyzing, then I choose an
appropriate project, I will not find a big technical barrier to pass this program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;pick-a-project-that-fit-with-my-knowledge&quot;&gt;Pick a project that fit with my knowledge&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means, I must look at the project task. With given time frame, which about
just 3 month, does it sound realistic that I will finish my task? That it’s, be
realistic is the key. Measure the difficulty of the task. When I face something
very unfamiliar and need more time to learn, I prefer to skip this. Because I
don’t want to spend my time in things that I less understand.&lt;br /&gt;
For example, this year, I choose project from GNU Wget that use C as their
programming language base, which currently I am familiar with. And for the task,
I pick idea of “Improvement of test suite using Libmicrohttpd”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;get-enganged-with-community&quot;&gt;Get enganged with community&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After I found the project that I want to apply, I must introduce myself to the
community. This is important step I must do. Because without it, mentor cannot
help me when I face difficulty.&lt;br /&gt;
Find the place where they collaborate. There are some choice like mailing list,
slack, gitter, irc, etc. GNU Wget use mailing list as they medium to
communicate between developer. I send welcome message there, and replied kindly
by other members.
Follow their rules. Basically, there are some rules to be obeyed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use plain English. GSoC is global program and use English as it language for
communication. So, I need to use English in my conversation.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Not to send message directly to the mentor or other person in the community.
This is considered to be rude. Instead, I will use mailing list if I need to
send a message.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Avoid top post when I reply an email.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;learn-their-environment-workflow-and-code-base&quot;&gt;Learn their environment, workflow and code base&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After I “Say Hi!” to the organization, now it’s time to dive into their code.
Find the repository. In Wget, their main repositories are hosted in Savannah,
Github and Gitlab. So, I clone the repo and then build the software from source.&lt;br /&gt;
I have successfully built Wget from source. Then I try to trace what the program
do using gdb, to take a look what is going on inside its process.&lt;br /&gt;
I familiarize my self with git, because Wget use git as its version control
system. Also the project uses Github to consolidate patches, open issue, write
wiki, etc. I try to hanging around on there. It fancy design keep me comfort
with environment and workflow of the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;submit-a-patch-event-with-a-trivial-one&quot;&gt;Submit a patch, event with a trivial one&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This patching section required quite technical skill. For newcomer like me, I
feel a bit confuse about what patch I can submit. Then, with guide from my
mentor, I was given an idea what simple task can be submitted. I pick an easy
one. A testing unit. Because, he mention, that Wget unit testing is still far
from perfect. I will take it for my chance. I try to add a function to reach
more coverage in the project unit test.&lt;br /&gt;
In order to merged into upstream, I need to make pull request on that project.
To be honest, it is my first time pull request in a real open source project.
Of course my patch will not merged automatically to the upstream. Mentor and the
community members will review first before it can be accepted. And after several
step, edit code, re-push commit with guide from my mentor and other contributors
that help me, finally my patch get merged on the upstream. It’s a nice feeling
for a rookie developer can have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;write-a-good-proposal&quot;&gt;Write a good proposal&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all, to be accepted in the GSoC program itself, I need to upload a
proposal. The proposal must be good enough to be considered accepted as GSoC
candidate. I pick the idea from list project that mentioned in project website.
I create a draft from this and share to other members. I receive a lot of
feedback. Thanks for who was concerned, so I can make improvements to my
proposal. After I feel it ready, I upload my final proposal to GSoC official.
And because the time between the date of proposal submit and the announcement of
accepted applicant is a month long, I will use it to get more familiar with
project code base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was my short list for what I do in order to be accepted to GSoC 2017. I
hope this article will help provide an overview of what preparations need to be
done so you can participate in GSoC. Good luck!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Convert Text to Pdf on Linux</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Background: failed to build linux kernel documentation (still too lazy to solve
problems).&lt;br /&gt;
Goal: generate pdf files of linux documentation, because I have reading problem
when using text files. Text files look ugly when I open using my reader
(Android).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Install needed packages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;$ sudo apt-get install enscript ps2pdf&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do this simple tricks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;$ &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; Documentation/
$ &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; i in &lt;span class=&quot;sb&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;ls -p &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; grep -v /&lt;span class=&quot;sb&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; enscript -p&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$i&lt;/span&gt;.ps &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;done&lt;/span&gt;
$ &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; i in &lt;span class=&quot;sb&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;ls *.ps&lt;span class=&quot;sb&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; ps2pdf &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;done&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I have pdf files of all the text files.&lt;br /&gt;
It still have a problem, it just convert files on the same directory. So other
files under this directory must be processed separately, which mean I must move
to each directory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Show line numbers on left&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-vim&quot; data-lang=&quot;vim&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;                                              &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disable code folding&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-vim&quot; data-lang=&quot;vim&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;nofoldenable&lt;/span&gt;                                        &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Scroll the window so we can always see 10 lines around the cursor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-vim&quot; data-lang=&quot;vim&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;scrolloff&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;                                        &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kernel coding style&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-vim&quot; data-lang=&quot;vim&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;tabstop&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;                                           
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;softtabstop&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;                                       
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;shiftwidth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;                                        
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;noexpandtab&lt;/span&gt;                                         &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Enable file type detection&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-vim&quot; data-lang=&quot;vim&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;filetype&lt;/span&gt; plugin indent &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;on&lt;/span&gt;                               &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shortcut to search visually selected text&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-vim&quot; data-lang=&quot;vim&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;vnoremap&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;sr&quot;&gt;//&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;C&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;R&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;CR&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Check if running on gvim&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-vim&quot; data-lang=&quot;vim&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; has&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;gui_running&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;                                   &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Set terminal color to 256&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-vim&quot; data-lang=&quot;vim&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;t_Co&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;256&lt;/span&gt;                                          &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Check if using Windows&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-vim&quot; data-lang=&quot;vim&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; has&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;win32&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;||&lt;/span&gt; has&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;win16&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;                       &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Set Ubuntu Mono font with size 11&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-vim&quot; data-lang=&quot;vim&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;guifont&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;Ubuntu\ Mono:h11                        &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Use solarized colorscheme&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-vim&quot; data-lang=&quot;vim&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;colorscheme&lt;/span&gt; solarized                                 &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Set the background to dark color&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-vim&quot; data-lang=&quot;vim&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;background&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/span&gt;                                   &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Highlight the current line&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-vim&quot; data-lang=&quot;vim&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;cursorline&lt;/span&gt;                                        &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Use letter as the print output format&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-vim&quot; data-lang=&quot;vim&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;printoptions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;paper:letter                         &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use Ubuntu font which can be download from
&lt;a href=&quot;http://font.ubuntu.com/&quot;&gt;font.ubuntu.com&lt;/a&gt;.
To enable solarized colorscheme, download file solarized.vim from
https://github.com/altercation/vim-colors-solarized/.
If you want to look my personal vim configuration, you can find it
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/dstw/dotfiles&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use this configuration in my Linux workstation and server.
I use exclusively for editing
linux kernel and other open source projects. For daily programming use, you can
change the value of tabstop, softtabstop and shiftwidth.&lt;br /&gt;
Happy Vimming!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Vim Quick Reference</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;For unfimiliar user, vim is a little bit confusing at first. But,
after you try it several times and configure properly, you will found this text
editor is very powerful.&lt;br /&gt;
Here I will note several subject how to use vim, because sometimes navigate to
vim help is quite difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vim is modal editor which means you use different mode to edit text. Some
important mode you will use very often are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Normal Mode&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can enter any command using &lt;code&gt;:&lt;/code&gt; or search using &lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt;
and &lt;code&gt;?&lt;/code&gt;. Press &lt;code&gt;Esc&lt;/code&gt; to enter this mode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Insert Mode&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Text you type is inserted into the buffer. Press &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; to enter this
mode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Visual Mode&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this mode, you can select the text we want in order to copy, cut or delete.
Press &lt;code&gt;v&lt;/code&gt; to enter this mode. The cursor position will be starting
point to your selection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;navigation&quot;&gt;Navigation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can move through the buffer with the following key:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Move left &lt;code&gt;h&lt;/code&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
Move right &lt;code&gt;l&lt;/code&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
Move up &lt;code&gt;k&lt;/code&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
Move down &lt;code&gt;j&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using this key will make your navigation faster than using arrow keys or mouse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Move one word &lt;code&gt;w&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Move one word backwards &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Move to end of line &lt;code&gt;$&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Move to beginning of line &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Insert text &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Insert text at the end of line &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Insert text at the beginning of line &lt;code&gt;I&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Insert text above line &lt;code&gt;O&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Insert text below line &lt;code&gt;o&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Replace one character &lt;code&gt;r&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Replace character consecutively &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt; (enter “replace mode”)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Page navigation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Move page down &lt;code&gt;ctrl + f&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Move page up &lt;code&gt;ctrl + b&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Move page half down &lt;code&gt;ctrl + d&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Move page half up &lt;code&gt;ctrl + u&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Move top &lt;code&gt;gg&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Move bottom &lt;code&gt;G&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Navigate through command history &lt;code&gt;q:&lt;/code&gt;
Navigate through search history &lt;code&gt;q/&lt;/code&gt;
Then you can select command or search result with navigation key. To execute
command, press &lt;code&gt;Enter&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;open-and-save-file&quot;&gt;Open and Save File&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open file &lt;code&gt;:e filename&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Save file &lt;code&gt;:w&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Saveas file &lt;code&gt;:w filename&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Quit &lt;code&gt;:q&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Quit without save&lt;code&gt;:q!&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Save file and quit&lt;code&gt;:wq&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;undo-and-redo&quot;&gt;Undo and Redo&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Undo &lt;code&gt;u&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Redo &lt;code&gt;ctrl + r&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;visual-selection&quot;&gt;Visual Selection&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use &lt;code&gt;v&lt;/code&gt; on text you want to select. You will enter visual mode.
Navigate using &lt;code&gt;hjkl&lt;/code&gt; key. Then we can do other action such as copy,
cut or delete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;copy-and-paste-text&quot;&gt;Copy and Paste Text&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After you select a text, you can do following action:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Copy &lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Cut/Delete &lt;code&gt;d&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Copy entire line &lt;code&gt;yy&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Cut entire line &lt;code&gt;dd&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Paste &lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;search-and-replace-text&quot;&gt;Search and Replace Text&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Find text &lt;code&gt;/query&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Find text upwards &lt;code&gt;?query&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Navigate between search results &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; to move forward and
&lt;code&gt;N&lt;/code&gt; to move backwards&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Find text using visually selected text, firstly add this line to vimrc file&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;vnoremap // y/&amp;lt;C-R&amp;gt;&quot;&amp;lt;CR&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;then select text in visual mode and press &lt;code&gt;//&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Replace text &lt;code&gt;:%s/old/new/g&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Replace all &lt;code&gt;:%s/old/new/gc&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;word-completion&quot;&gt;Word Completion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can autocomplete text with several method to get different result:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Search text before cursor &lt;code&gt;ctrl + p&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Search text after cursor &lt;code&gt;ctrl + n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Search for filename complete with its path &lt;code&gt;ctrl + x&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code&gt;ctrl + f&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;multi-window-editing&quot;&gt;Multi Window Editing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open new window &lt;code&gt;:new&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Open new vertical window &lt;code&gt;:vnew&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Move through window &lt;code&gt;ctrl + w&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;w&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Swap window position &lt;code&gt;ctrl + w&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;r&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;compare-buffer&quot;&gt;Compare Buffer&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have two split windows containing buffers that you want to compare, then
you can diff them by running &lt;code&gt;:windo diffthis&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
You can turn diff mode off just as easily, by running &lt;code&gt;:windo diffoff
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s how I use vim in daily life.
For my personal preference, I have modified my vimrc which you can find

        <title>Octopress Setup and Deployment</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I will explain how to setup a new blog using octopress, deploy it on github and
contribute from other place. Let’s check this out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;first-time-setup&quot;&gt;First Time Setup&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prerequisite:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Install Git and Node.js&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On debian system, use apt-get.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;$ sudo apt-get install git
$ sudo apt-get install nodejs&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Install Ruby&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We must use version 1.9.3 or higher. To ensure we fulfill this requirement, I
prefer to install ruby from source. Download from
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/&quot;&gt;Ruby official site&lt;/a&gt;. The installation
process is quite common.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;$ tar zxf ruby-2.3.1.tar.gz 
$ &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; ruby-2.3.1/
$ ./configure
$ sudo make &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; make install &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Install ExecJS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To run JavaScript code from Ruby.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;$ sudo gem install execjs&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Configure bundle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another octopress dependency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;$ sudo gem install bundler&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all needed requirements fulfilled, then grab the octopress source code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;$ git clone git://github.com/imathis/octopress.git octopress
$ &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; octopress&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One more dependency:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;$ bundle install&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then install octopress default theme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;$ rake install&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Setup process is finished. We can now start to blog using rake newpost[“title”], 
customize _config.yml, add some pages, customize 404 not found page, using
custom domain name and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;deploy-on-github&quot;&gt;Deploy on Github&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some way to deploy octopress, either using rsync or git. In this
post, I will explain how to deploy octopress on Github.
Create a new Github repository and name the repository with the format
username.github.io, where username is your GitHub username or organization name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Github Pages for users and organizations uses the master branch like the public 
directory on a web server, serving up the files at your Pages url 
http://username.github.io. As a result, we will to work on the source for 
our blog in the source branch and commit the generated content to the master 
branch. Octopress has a configuration task that helps us set all this up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;$ rake setup_github_pages&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rake task will ask for a URL of the Github repo. Copy the SSH or HTTPS URL 
from our newly created repository
(e.g. git@github.com:username/username.github.io.git)
and paste it in as a response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ask for and store our Github Pages repository url&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Rename the remote pointing to imathis/octopress from ‘origin’ to ‘octopress’&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Add our Github Pages repository as the default origin remote&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Switch the active branch from master to source&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Configure our blog’s url according to your repository&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Setup a master branch in the _deploy directory for deployment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next run:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;$ rake generate
$ rake deploy&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will generate our blog, copy the generated files into _deploy/, add them 
to git, commit and push them up to the master branch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t forget to commit the source of our blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;$ git add .
$ git commit -m &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;our message&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
$ git push origin &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;source&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With new repositories, Github sets the default branch based on the branch we 
push first, and it looks there for the generated site content. If we’re having 
trouble getting Github to publish our site, go to the admin panel for our 
repository and make sure that the master branch is the default branch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;contribute-from-other-place&quot;&gt;Contribute from Other Place&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes we need to develop our octopress site in other place than we currently
in. To do that, we will use the benefit of git.&lt;br /&gt;
First, we need to get our site copy:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;$ git clone git@github.com:username/username.github.io.git
$ &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; username.github.io&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Switch to source branch&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;$ git checkout &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;source&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then do all change on our source, after that run “rake generate” or “rake
preview” to compile our source onto public directory. Everything seems to be
okay until we need to upload to github.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;$ rake deploy
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;## Deploying branch to Github Pages &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;## Pulling any updates from Github Pages &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; _deploy
rake aborted!
Errno::ENOENT: No such file or directory @ dir_chdir - _deploy
/home/didik/octopress/Rakefile:255:in &lt;span class=&quot;sb&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;block in &amp;lt;top &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;required&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;/home/didik/octopress/Rakefile:227:in `block in &amp;lt;top (required)&amp;gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
Tasks: &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;TOP&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt; deploy
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;See full trace by running task with --trace&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oops, it’s look like we miss something. We have to make a new _deploy directory 
and add git initialization to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;$ mkdir _deploy
$ &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; _deploy
$ git init
$ git remote add origin git@github.com:username/username.github.io.git
$ git pull origin master
$ &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; ..&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s all. Now, we can upload using rake deploy as usual.&lt;br /&gt;
Until next time.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>My Blog</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;As a person who use internet in daily basis, I think something
personal like a domain name is essential to have. But, there is no good
personal domain name available for free. Fortunately, the price to “borrow” a
domain name from the registrar is fairly affordable. So, without even thinking
more about price to pay, I decided that what I invested in this thing will
someday get useful for everyone, in anyway.&lt;br /&gt;
After I “reserved” one domain name, I need to associate it with other service.
The two things that important to be setting up immediately are blog and email. &lt;br /&gt;
Blog is like my “broadcasting center”. I store my notes, my journals there.
Everyone is welcome to visit there, and I hope it can help someone to answer
their question someday. Email become my virtual identity. I use it to register
to many service on the internet. Especially with my own custom domain name,
I can make my blog and email look more personally.
Here I explain how I build my blog step by step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;domain-name&quot;&gt;Domain Name&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I register my domain from a web hosting provider. I just pay for the domain
name, not the hosting service.&lt;br /&gt;
About what provider I currently use, it can be found using a domain tool easily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;blog&quot;&gt;Blog&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to build my infrastructure, I need to have a server, dedicated internet
or static IP address to run the software up. But I don’t have any of them, so I
just use free service from external providers. There is a lot of providers who
can give us some space to host our web and email.&lt;br /&gt;
In early time I touch with internet, I did use some blogging framework to run my
blog. I ever use Blogger, Joomla, Drupal and Wordpress. I spend a long time with 
Wordpress. But, due to personal favor, finally I switch to Octopress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why Octopress? Because that is simple. It has beautiful design, while easy to 
use. I can create post directly from Vim on my Linux console. 
It can be updated using git, so I can feel the sysadmin way to write a post. 
It use a simplify html-like syntax, markdown. 
I can host my blog together with my application repository in 
&lt;a href=&quot;www.github.com&quot;&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt;. You can check this
&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2016/06/02/octopress-setup-and-deployment/&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; 
for more details. 
With this Octopress take control my way to blog,
I can focus on contents that I want to share rather than 
have to be confused to setup and design my blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ssl&quot;&gt;SSL&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For security purpose, I use free ssl service from 
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cloudflare.com&quot;&gt;CloudFlare&lt;/a&gt;. The setup process is fairly easy.
The requirements for its service is just a domain name with top level domain.
I just need to set my DNS configuration to point CloudFlare DNS. Additionally, 
there is a feature so I can force my blog visitor to use https in order to see
the ssl sign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;email&quot;&gt;Email&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than using well-known free email service, I need to host my own email
because I want to use my own domain name. Fortunately, there is email provider 
that provide free email service using custom domain, thanks to
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zoho.com&quot;&gt;Zoho Mail&lt;/a&gt;.
Even with free service, I can use my own domain name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s all about my blog. I hope it all will be useful. Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Insert USB Module in Linux Kernel</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;After I re-compile my kernel using a vanilla one, I found that my usb flashdrive 
can not be detected by my operating system. I check on dmesg, there are entry
about my usb flashdrive on the log:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;didik@thinkpad:~$ dmesg

&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;123&lt;/span&gt;.710606&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; usb &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;-1.2: New USB device found, &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;idVendor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;0951&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;idProduct&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;1666&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;123&lt;/span&gt;.710617&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; usb &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;-1.2: New USB device strings: &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;Mfr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;Product&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;SerialNumber&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;123&lt;/span&gt;.710631&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; usb &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;-1.2: Product: DataTraveler &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;.0
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;123&lt;/span&gt;.710634&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; usb &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;-1.2: Manufacturer: Kingston

--- output omitted ---&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, after a moment I wait, there is no notification about new flashdrive
inserted. I check using blkid, still there is no sign of the thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;didik@thinkpad:~$ sudo blkid
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;sudo&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; password &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; didik: 
/dev/sda1: &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;LABEL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;SYSTEM&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;UUID&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;70E80099E8005FA8&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;TYPE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;ntfs&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;PARTUUID&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;ba6ded71-01&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
/dev/sda2: &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;UUID&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;92521783-0211-4b1d-8f66-b9a62c16fc89&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;UUID_SUB&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;fdb1cb3e-1a44-4e53-864e-b29f6fdfb153&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;TYPE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;btrfs&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;PARTUUID&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;ba6ded71-02&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
/dev/sda3: &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;UUID&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;4723c4f7-9624-4b8d-9b41-3079442641b4&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;TYPE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;swap&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;PARTUUID&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;ba6ded71-03&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
/dev/sda5: &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;LABEL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;DATA&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;UUID&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;01CD0094E26EBB80&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;TYPE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;ntfs&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;PARTUUID&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;ba6ded71-05&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apparently, I forget to insert usb-storage module in my kernel, after I
recompile it. So, I try to modprobe the needed module.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;didik@thinkpad:~$ modprobe usb-storage
modprobe: FATAL: Module usb-storage not found in directory /lib/modules/4.6.2&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, it seems that the file I need is not available from the kernel tree. So, I
need to insert the module manually.&lt;br /&gt;
Time to go to kernel tree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;didik@thinkpad:~$ &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; linux-4.6.2/
didik@thinkpad:~/linux-4.6.2$ make menuconfig&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From this menu, I will include the module that I need for usb-storage. Press /
to search module name. It is called USB_STORAGE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/usb-module0.png&quot; alt=&quot;usb-module0.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After I found its location, I insert it with “M” become my choice between the
tri-state mode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/usb-module1.png&quot; alt=&quot;usb-module1.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I exit and save this configuration.&lt;br /&gt;
Then I make it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;didik@thinkpad:~/linux-4.6.2$ make -j4&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that the “4” value is changeable depends on processor specs.&lt;br /&gt;
I use “4” because my processor 
Install old and new compiled module, as root of course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;didik@thinkpad:~/linux-4.6.2$ sudo make modules_install&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My new module finally installed. Now I can plug the usb drive on my computer.&lt;br /&gt;
Just in case you are curious about system message of the inserted device, you 
can use dmesg.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;didik@thinkpad:~$ dmesg

        <title>Build Custom Linux Kernel</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;install-custom-linux-kernel&quot;&gt;Install Custom Linux Kernel&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To build this custom Linux Kernel, I use Ubuntu 14.04 64 bit operating system.
At first, ensure all the required utilities installed correctly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;$ sudo apt-get install gcc make git libssl-dev libncurses5-dev&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Download source from Linux Kernel Archives, for example, I use version 4.4.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://cdn.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v4.x/linux-4.4.tar.xz&quot;&gt;https://cdn.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v4.x/linux-4.4.tar.xz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Extract the tarball file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;$ tar xJf linux-4.4.tar.xz
$ &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; linux-4.4&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to change configuration parameters to determine which settings and modules we need to build.
Use make *config command as follow. 
Choose one that match to your favor.
I usually use number 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;1-use-default-kernel-configuration&quot;&gt;1. Use default kernel configuration.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This settings comes from the kernel maintainer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;$ make defconfig &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;2-use-our-existing-configuration&quot;&gt;2. Use our existing configuration.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just press “Enter” when asked for configuration options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;$ make localmodconfig&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;3-manual-selection-with-graphical-menu&quot;&gt;3. Manual selection with graphical menu.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;$ make menuconfig&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;4--duplicate-our-current-config&quot;&gt;4.  Duplicate our current config.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;$ sudo cp /boot/config-&lt;span class=&quot;sb&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;uname -r&lt;span class=&quot;sb&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;* .config&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, compile source, this process can take a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;$ make -j4 &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The parameter “4” is based on processor specification.
Set this at your own favor.&lt;br /&gt;
Install modules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;$ sudo make modules_install &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bootloader setup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;$ sudo make install &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Double check bootloader setup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;$ sudo update-grub2 &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reboot the system.
We can check our new installed kernel with this command.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;$ uname -a&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;uninstall-custom-linux-kernel&quot;&gt;Uninstall Custom Linux Kernel&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Find out the version of custom kernel.&lt;br /&gt;
Update filesystem search index.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;$ sudo updatedb&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this example, I want to remove kernel version 3.16.0-30-generic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;$ &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;CUSTOM_KERNEL_VERSION&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;3.16.0-30-generic&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
$ locate &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$CUSTOM_KERNEL_VERSION&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ensure our system has other kernel installed beside $CUSTOM_KERNEL_VERSION.&lt;br /&gt;
Then, delete all files &amp;amp; folders which contain $CUSTOM_KERNEL_VERSION name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;$ sudo rm /boot/vmlinuz-&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$CUSTOM_KERNEL_VERSION&lt;/span&gt;
$ sudo rm /boot/initrd.img-&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$CUSTOM_KERNEL_VERSION&lt;/span&gt;
$ sudo rm /boot/System.map-&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$CUSTOM_KERNEL_VERSION&lt;/span&gt;
$ sudo rm /boot/config-&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$CUSTOM_KERNEL_VERSION&lt;/span&gt;
$ sudo rm -rf /lib/modules/&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$CUSTOM_KERNEL_VERSION&lt;/span&gt;/
$ sudo rm /var/lib/initramfs-tools/&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$CUSTOM_KERNEL_VERSION&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do some cleaning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;$ sudo update-initramfs -k all -u
$ sudo update-grub2&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finish. Our custom kernel has been uninstalled from our system.&lt;/p&gt;
